# **App Name**: FormForge

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop Components: Allow users to drag and drop various form components (text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.) onto a canvas to design their form.
- Dynamic Configuration: Provide a configuration panel that allows users to modify the properties of each selected form component (e.g., label, type, validation rules).
- Form Preview: Enable a preview mode that renders the form as it would appear to the end-user, allowing for real-time adjustments and testing.
- Code Generation: Generate LWC (Lightning Web Components) code based on the designed form layout and configuration. Offer options for different output formats.
- AI-Powered Field Suggestion Tool: Suggest appropriate field types and validation rules based on the label/name of the field.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) to convey professionalism and trust, referencing traditional form design aesthetics.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), offering a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for form design.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), providing subtle contrast and highlighting interactive elements. DO NOT SUGGEST TEAL.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a clean, modern, neutral appearance that maintains readability in both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, simple icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different form components.
- Divide the UI into three clear sections: component library, form canvas, and configuration panel. Use a grid-based layout to ensure consistent spacing and alignment.
- Use subtle animations for drag-and-drop actions, component selection, and configuration changes to provide visual feedback to the user.
